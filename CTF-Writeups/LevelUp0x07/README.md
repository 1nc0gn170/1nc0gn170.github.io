## Port Knocking

### Description
```
Dear agent_521bcd5,

As ordered by Matriarch, I have created a backdoor console that will allow us to launch WannaSpy when time is right.

We're not worried about anyone getting in since they have to go through many doors to actually get in.

Once you are ready, you will find that the console lives on 3389.


Regards

> Port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s).
